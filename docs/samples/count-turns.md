![count turns program](../images/generated/sample_count_turns.png){:class="sample"}

This program requires a [Jacdac dial (rotary encoder) module](https://microsoft.github.io/jacdac-docs/devices/kittenbot/rotarybuttonv10/).
The dial tile raises two events: turn left and turn right.

The program counts the number of times the dial was turned left (in the variable `X`) and the number of times the dial was turned right (in the variable `Y`), displaying the count for each turn.
