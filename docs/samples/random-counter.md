![random counter program](../images/generated/sample_random_counter.png){:class="sample"}

When you press the A button, this program sets variable `X` to a random number between 2 and 6, sets variable `Y` to zero, and
then displays the value of variable `X`. Each time you press the B button, the value of variable `Y` is increased by one.
When the value of variable `Y` becomes equal to the value of variable `X`, a smiley face is shown.
