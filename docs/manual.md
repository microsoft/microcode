-   Kid-friendly icon-based code editor and programming language
-   Runs on the micro:bit V2 or in web browser
-   Keyboard, mouse, touch, screen reader accessible
-   Accessories (LEDs, motors, ...) supported via [Jacdac](https://aka.ms/jacdac)

## Try it out!

There are two ways to run MicroCode:

-   [web app](https://aka.ms/microcode) with [micro:bit V2](https://microbit.org) connected via WebUSB
-   [micro:bit V2](https://microbit.org) + [Arcade Shield](https://www.kittenbot.cc/products/newbit-arcade-shield)

See below for more information about the MicroCode web app, and how to deploy MicroCode to the micro:bit V2. Regardless of which way you run MicroCode, you will probably want to know a little bit about
MicroCode's:

## [Web editor](https://aka.ms/m9)

The easiest way to get started with MicroCode is through the web editor ([https://aka.ms/microcode](https://aka.ms/microcode), [aka.ms/m9](https://aka.ms/m9) for short). We recommend using the keyboard navigation or a real gamepad!

-   Arrow keys for D-pad
-   `Enter` or `Space` for `A` button
-   `Backspace` for `B` button
-   Copy the URL to share your program.

### Web App and micro:bit V2

Click on the micro:bit button at the lower right of the web app (see above) and follow the on-screen instructions to configure your micro:bit V2 and pair it with the editor.
Once your micro:bit V2 is paired, the web editor will be able to download your
MicroCode program to your micro:bit. This happens on every edit, so your program
is always up-to-date (and running)!

### Accessibility

We want to make the editor as accessible as possible; please send us suggestions to improve its accessibility.

#### Keyboard navigation

MicroCode can be accessed with the keyboard:

-   Arrow keys for D-pad
-   `Enter` or `Space` for `A` button
-   `Backspace` for `B` button

#### Gamepad support

MicroCode supports commercial gamepads compatible with [Web Gamepad](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Gamepad).

#### Screen reader

The editor integrates with existing screen readers, like NVDA.

#### Tooltip read aloud

By clicking on the `tooltip reader` button at the bottom of the editor, the tooltips will be read aloud. This may be useful for students who are still learning to read.

## micro:bit V2 and Arcade Shield

Click on the version number in the web app to download the MicroCode hex file to your micro:bit V2. When you plug the micro:bit into the Arcade Shield, MicroCode should start running. Your MicroCode program is always live and runnable. Once you remove the micro:bit from the shield, the program will persist and continue to run.
