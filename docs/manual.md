## Try it out!

There are two ways to run MicroCode:

-   [micro:bit V2](https://microbit.org) + [Arcade Shield](https://www.kittenbot.cc/products/newbit-arcade-shield)
-   [Web editor](https://aka.ms/microcode) with or without micro:bit V2

See below for more information about the MicroCode web app, and how to deploy MicroCode to the micro:bit V2. Regardless of which way you run MicroCode, you will probably want to know a little bit about the MicroCode
or the

## Web editor

The easiest way to get started with MicroCode is through the web editor ([https://aka.ms/microcode](https://aka.ms/microcode), shown below). We recommend using the keyboard navigation or a real gamepad!

-   Arrow keys for D-pad
-   Space bar for A button
-   Backscape for B button
-   Copy the URL to share your program.

### Web App and micro:bit V2

Click on the micro:bit button at the lower right of the screen and follow the
on-screen instructions to configure your micro:bit V2 and pair it with the editor.
Once your micro:bit V2 is paired, the web editor will be able to download Your
MicroCode program to your microbit. This happens on every edit, so your program
is always up-to-date (and running)!

## Micro:bit simulator

The simulator link will open a page with the MicroCode web app on the right side and a micro:bit simulator and Jacdac dashboard on the left, as shown below. Your MicroCode program is saved, compiled and updated to the micro:bit (simulator or device) on every edit, so everything should be live and running all the time.
