# [Microsoft MicroCode](https://aka.ms/m9) for micro:bit (beta)

Physical computing for young coders and coders with disabilities on the [micro:bit V2](https://microbit.org).

> MicroCode is still in **beta** development and might change in the future. Post your suggestions or questions on the [forum](https://forum.makecode.com/c/60).

-   Kid-friendly icon-based, live, structured code editor and [programming language](./language)

<video class="sample" poster="./videos/smiley-buttons.png" src="./videos/smiley-buttons.mp4" controls="true"></video>

-   Live, the code is downloaded to the micro:bit on every edit
-   Cursor based navigation with keyboard (switch access compatible), mouse, touch, screen reader support
-   Accessories (LEDs, servos, ...) supported via [Jacdac](https://aka.ms/jacdac)

## [Web editor](https://aka.ms/m9) {#web}

The MicroCode web editor is at [aka.ms/m9](https://aka.ms/m9). We recommend using the keyboard navigation. MicroCode is designed to be friendly to switch access devices.

-   `Left`, `Right`, `Up`, `Down` moves the cursor
    -   the `Left` and `Right` keys will wrap around in the editor on the **same** page
    -   the `Up` key on top of the screen will act as `back`. It will go back the pages until page 1 is in focus, then pressing up will go back to the start screen.
    -   the `Down` key will wrap around the pages
-   `Enter` or `Space` for `A` button
-   `Backspace` for `B` button
-   `]` or `Page Up` to go to the next page, `[` or `Page Down` to go to the previous page
-   Copy the URL to share your program.

### Automatic download to micro:bit V2

Click on the micro:bit button at the lower right of the web app (see above) and follow the on-screen instructions to configure your micro:bit V2 and pair it with the editor.
Once your micro:bit V2 is paired, the web editor will be able to download your
MicroCode program to your micro:bit. This happens on every edit, so your program
is always up-to-date (and running)!

If you micro:bit disconnect, you will see a micro:bit icon show up on the upper left corner of the editor. Click on that button to reconnect again

### Accessibility

We want to make the editor as accessible as possible; please send us suggestions to improve its accessibility.

#### Keyboard navigation

MicroCode can be accessed with the keyboard:

-   Arrow keys to move cursor
-   `Enter` or `Space` for `A` button
-   `Backspace` for `B` button
-   Keep moving the cursor `Up` to go back a screen, if `Backspace` is not available;
    for example, if you are using a 5-input switch panel.
-   Keep moving `Right` or `Left` to wrap around the user interface; for example, if you are using a 2-input switch panel.

#### Gamepads

MicroCode supports commercial gamepads compatible with [Web Gamepad](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Gamepad).

#### Screen reader

The editor integrates with existing screen readers, like NVDA.

#### Tooltip read aloud

By clicking on the `tooltip reader` button at the bottom of the editor, the tooltips will be read aloud. This may be useful for students who are still learning to read.

## [Sample programs](./samples)

The MicroCode app has a set of [samples](./samples) built-in. Select the samples button on the MicroCode home page (see below) to reveal

## Accessories

MicroCode supports Jacdac modules to extend the micro:bit device with LEDs, servos, motors, ...
In this video, we launch an LED animation when a clap is detected.

## micro:bit V2 and Arcade Shield

> This functionality is experimental.

Click on the version number in the web app to download the MicroCode hex file to your micro:bit V2. When you plug the micro:bit into the Arcade Shield, MicroCode should start running. Your MicroCode program is always live and runnable. Once you remove the micro:bit from the shield, the program will persist and continue to run.
