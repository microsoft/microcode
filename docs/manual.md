-   Kid friendly iconic editor and small programming language
-   Runs on the micro:bit V2, no computer or internet needed
-   Keyboard, screen reader accessible

## Try it out!

There are two ways to run MicroCode:

-   micro:bit V2 + [Arcade Shield](https://www.kittenbot.cc/products/newbit-arcade-shield)
-   [web editor](https://aka.ms/microcode) with or without micro:bit V2

See below for more information about the MicroCode web app, micro:bit simulator, and how to deploy MicroCode to the micro:bit V2. Regardless of which way you run MicroCode, you will probably want to know a little bit about the MicroCode
or the

-   [samples](./samples.md)
-   [FAQ](./faq.md)

## Web editor

The easiest way to get started with MicroCode is through the web editor ([https://aka.ms/microcode](https://aka.ms/microcode), shown below). We recommend using the keyboard navigation or a real gamepad!

-   Arrow keys for D-pad
-   Space bar for A button
-   Backscape for B button
-   Copy the URL to share your program.

## Micro:bit simulator

From the web app, make sure that the web browser is not full screen and you will see four links at the bottom of the app (see image above):

-   **Manual** (this page)
-   **Simulator**
-   **GitHub** (this repo)
-   **Version #** (links to micro:bit hex file)

Clicking on the simulator link will open a page with the MicroCode web app on the right side and a micro:bit simulator and Jacdac dashboard on the left, as shown below. Your MicroCode program is saved, compiled and updated to the micro:bit (simulator or device) on every edit, so everything should be live and running all the time.
