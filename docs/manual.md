## Try it out!

There are two ways to run MicroCode:

-   micro:bit V2 + [Arcade Shield](https://www.kittenbot.cc/products/newbit-arcade-shield)
-   [web editor](https://microsoft.github.io/microcode) with or without micro:bit V2

See below for more information about the MicroCode web app, micro:bit simulator, and how to deploy MicroCode to the micro:bit V2. Regardless of which way you run MicroCode, you will probably want to know a little bit about the MicroCode 
or the 

* [icon-based language](./language.md)
* [samples](./samples.md)

## Web editor

The easiest way to get started with MicroCode is through the web editor ([https://microsoft.github.io/microcode](https://microsoft.github.io/microcode), shown below. We recommend using the keyboard navigationor a real gamepad!

-   Arrow keys for D-pad
-   Space bar for A button
-   Backscape for B button

## Micro:bit simulator

From the web app, make sure that the web browser is not full screen and you will see four links at the bottom of the app (see image above):

-   **Manual** (this page)
-   **Simulator**
-   **GitHub** (this repo)
-   **Version #** (links to micro:bit hex file)

Clicking on the simulator link will open a page with the MicroCode web app on the right side and a micro:bit simulator and Jacdac dashboard on the left, as shown below. Your MicroCode program is saved, compiled and updated to the micro:bit (simulator or device) on every edit, so everything should be live and running all the time.

## Downloading Micro:bit V2

Click on the micro:bit button at the lower right of the screen and follow the
on-screen instructions to configure your micro:bit and pair it with the editor.
Once your micro:bit V2 is paired, the web editor will be able to download the program in your microbit.
