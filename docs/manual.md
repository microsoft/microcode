Physical computing and robotics for young learners with the [micro:bit V2](https://microbit.org) (_no tablet/laptop/desktop required_):

-   [arcade shields](#arcade-shields) for the micro:bit V2 enable "on the go" programming with familiar game console controls
-   kid-friendly, icon-based, structured code editor and [programming language](./language)
-   lots of [sample programs](./samples) to get started
-   [translated](#localization) in 20+ languages
-   remote control a [micro:bit robot](./robot) using MicroCode
    to follow lines, avoid obstacles and more.
-   extend and program your creation with [Jacdac accessories](#jacdac) (LEDs, servos, ...)

## Getting started

Regardless of whether you are using the Arcade shield or web app, you first need to download the (localized) MicroCode hex file to your micro:bit V2. There are two ways to do this:

1. visit the [web app](https://aka.ms/microcode) and follow directions to connect your micro:bit and [automatically download over WebUSB](#download)
2. visit the [localization](#localization) section to _download_ the MicroCode hex file to your computer and copy to your micro:bit V2 (plugged into your computer via USB).

## Arcade shields {#arcade-shield}

Three Arcade shields for the micro:bit V2 are available on the market today, as shown below. After downloading the MicroCode hex file to your micro:bit V2, whenever you plug the micro:bit into the Arcade Shield, MicroCode should start running. Your MicroCode program is always live and runnable. Once you remove the micro:bit from the shield, the program will persist and continue to run (assuming the micro:bit is still powered, of course).

## Accessories {#jacdac}

MicroCode supports accessories to extend the micro:bit device with LEDs, servos, motors, ...
In this video, we launch an LED animation when a clap is detected. The accessories are powered by [Jacdac](https://microsoft.github.io/jacdac-docs).

## Web editor

<video class="sample" poster="./videos/smiley-buttons.png" src="./videos/smiley-buttons.mp4" controls="true"></video>

The MicroCode web editor is at [aka.ms/microcode](https://aka.ms/microcode).
We recommend using the keyboard navigation:

-   `Left`, `Right`, `Up`, `Down` moves the cursor
    -   the `Left` and `Right` keys will wrap around in the editor on the **same** page
    -   the `Up` key on top of the screen will act as `back`. It will go back the pages until page 1 is in focus, then pressing up will go back to the start screen.
    -   the `Down` key will wrap around the pages
-   `Enter` or `Space` for `A` button
-   `Backspace` for `B` button
-   `]` or `Page Up` to go to the next page, `[` or `Page Down` to go to the previous page
-   Copy the URL to share your program.

### Automatic download to micro:bit V2 {#download}

When the editor does not detect any micro:bit, it will automatically prompt you with instructions
on how to connect. Once your micro:bit V2 is paired, the web editor will be able to download your
MicroCode program to your micro:bit. This happens on every edit, so your program
is always up-to-date (and running)!

> If your micro:bit disconnects, you will see a micro:bit icon show up on the upper left corner of the editor. Click on that button to reconnect again.

### Accessibility

We want to make the editor as accessible as possible; please send us suggestions to improve its accessibility.

#### Keyboard navigation

MicroCode can be accessed with the keyboard:

-   Arrow keys to move cursor
-   `Enter` or `Space` for `A` button
-   `Backspace` for `B` button
-   Keep moving the cursor `Up` to go back a screen, if `Backspace` is not available;
    for example, if you are using a 5-input switch panel.
-   Keep moving `Right` or `Left` to wrap around the user interface; for example,
    if you are using a 2-input switch panel.

#### Gamepads

MicroCode supports game console controllers compatible with [Web Gamepad](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Gamepad).

#### Screen reader

The editor integrates with existing screen readers, like NVDA.

#### Tooltip read aloud

By clicking on the `tooltip reader` button at the bottom of the editor, the tooltips will be read aloud. This may be useful for students who are still learning to read.

### Program slots ![disk icon 1](./images/generated/icon_disk1.png) ![disk icon 2](./images/generated/icon_disk2.png) ![disk icon 3](./images/generated/icon_disk3.png) {#program-slots}

There are three slots for saving user programs for later load/restore. From the editor, click on the disk icon
![disk icon](./images/generated/icon_disk.png)
in the upper left to select which slot to save the current program to. From the home screen, select the disk icon to load a program from one of the three save slots.
