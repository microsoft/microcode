## How do I share my program?

From the web editor, copy the URL... it contains your whole program.

## How do I print my program?

Click the `screenshot` button at the bottom to get a rendered image of your program that you can share and print.

## How do I translate MicroCode?

Checkout the [localization](./localization) to see how you can help or use a localized build of MicroCode.

## My micro:bit froze and is showing a number

This typically means that MicroCode had a bug and crashed. Here are a few common error codes that are scrolled on the screen:

-   **540**: The .hex download was interrupted or failed. Try downloading the .hex file again.
-   **020**: Out of memory! Your program is so big that it does not fit in memory anymore... or we have a memory leak somewhere. Try resetting the micro:bit.

Other error codes are [documented in MakeCode](https://makecode.microbit.org/device/error-codes).

## How do I add support for my robot?

If your robot is not [listed](./robots-supported), follow the [instructions](./robots-supported#new-robot) to get it added to the list.
