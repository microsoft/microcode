## Jacdac

MicroCode integrates with [Jacdac](https://aka.ms.jacdac) in several ways

-   the MicroCode program is compiled to the bytecode of the Jacdac virtual machine (JDVM), which can be run on the same micro:bit or exported to other micro:bits
-   the MicroCode editor recognizes a small set of Jacdac modules, when connected, providing programming tiles for those modules
